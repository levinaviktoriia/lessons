		<div class="header__text">
			<p><span>Lagom</span> (pronounced [ˈlɑ̂ːɡɔm], LAW-gom) is a Swedish word meaning "just the right amount" or "not too much, not too little".</p>
			<p>The word can be variously translated as "in moderation", "in balance", "perfect-simple", "just enough", "ideal" and "suitable" (in matter of amounts). Whereas words like sufficient and average suggest some degree of abstinence, scarcity, or failure, lagom carries the connotation of appropriateness, although not necessarily perfection. The archetypical Swedish proverb "Lagom är bäst", literally "The right amount is best", is also translated as "Enough is as good as a feast", or as "There is virtue in moderation".</p>

			<h2 class="block__title">Etymology</h2>
			<div class="block__text">
				<p>The origin of the term is an archaic dative plural form of lag ("law"), in this case referring not necessarily to judicial law but common sense law. Literally meaning "according to law", a more close translation would be "according to custom" or "according to common sense". The earliest attestations of the word are from 17th century texts.</p>
				<p>A common false etymology claims that it is a contraction of "laget om" ("around the team"); according to this myth, the phrase was used in Viking times to specify how much mead one should drink from the horn as it was passed around in order for everyone to receive a fair share.</p>

			<h2 class="block__title">Use</h2>
			<div class="block__text">
				<p>Lagom is most often used as an adverb, as in the sentence "Han är lagom lång" (literally "He is just the right height"). Lagom can also be used as an adjective: "Klänningen var lagom för henne" (literally "The dress was just right for her"), which would be equivalent to "The dress fits her". The adjective form is never inflected.</p>
			</div>

		<div class="block" id="cultural-sign">
			<h2 class="block__title">Cultural significance</h2>
			<div class="block__text">
				<p>The value of "just enough" can be compared to the idiom "less is more", or contrasted to the value of "more is better". It is viewed favorably as a sustainable alternative to the hoarding extremes of consumerism: "Why do I need more than two? Det är [It is] lagom" It can also be viewed as repressive: "You're not supposed to be too good, or too rich".</p>
				<p>In a single word, lagom is said to describe the basis of the Swedish national psyche, one of consensus and equality. "My aunt used to hold out her closed fist and say, "How much can you get in this hand? It's much easier to get something in this [open] hand".</p>

			<h2 class="block__title">Comparable terms in other languages</h2>
			<div class="block__text">
				<p>The word <span>"lagom"</span> also exists in Norwegian, in both Bokmål and Nynorsk. The connotations in Norwegian, however, are somewhat different from Swedish. In Norwegian the word has synonyms as "fitting, suitable, comfortable, nice, decent, well built/proportioned". While some synonyms are somewhat similar in meaning (e.g. "suitable" and "reasonable", "fitting" and "in balance"), many present in Swedish do not exist in Norwegian and vice versa. The Norwegian words <span>"passelig"</span> and the more common "passe" are very similar, translating roughly as "fitting, adequate, suitable" in English. <span>"Passe"</span> can be used in every context where the Swedish "lagom" is used, e.g. <span>"passe varm"</span> (right temperature/adequately warm), <span>"passe stor"</span> (right size), etc.</p>
				<p>Finnish has the word <span>"Sopivasti"</span>, which carries similar connotations of "just right".</p>
				<p>The concept of <span>lagom</span> is similar to Ukrainian expression <span>normal'no</span> (нормально, literally normally), which indicates a sufficient and sustainable state, for example of one's livelihood. In Ukrainian, the word is often used as answer to the question "how are you". Polish <span>w sam raz</span> means the same as lagom. Comparable terms are found in some south Slavic languages, for example Serbo-Croatian <span>umereno</span> or <span>umjereno</span>. In Slovakia, expression <span>"tak akurát"</span> is used.</p>
				<p>Ιn ancient Greek, there was the famous phrase of Cleobulus, <span>metron ariston</span> (μέτρον ἄριστον), meaning "moderation [literally: measure] is best".</p>
				<p>In Albanian there is the same use of word "taman". The word "taman" derives from Ottoman Turkish "tamam" meaning "precisely", borrowed from Arabic where it means "complete", "perfect". In Albanian is used pretty much the same as "lagom", as in "a <span>taman</span> amount", "not a <span>taman</span> person" (not a normal person), "taman!" (agreed, OK), etc. This word ("taman") is also used in some Slavic languages (South Slavic) and it almost perfectly translates "lagom" to those languages.</p>
				<p>In Thai, the word พอเพียง (phor phiang) portrays similar meaning.</p>
				<p>In Indonesia, both Indonesian and Javanese, there is a common word for that, <span>pas</span>, which means right amount (countable measurement), match, enough.</p>
				<p>In Swiss German dialects exists, similar to lagom, the word "gäbig", which in German means something like "comfortable", "suitable", "handy", in the case of objects or in relation to people and conditions "affable", "pleasant", "sympathetic".</p>

			<h2 class="block__title">How to make life more orderly and live in harmony with the whole world?</h2>
			<div class="block__text">
				<p>Here are some tips from author Elisabeth Carlsson in her book on lagums:</p>
			</div>
			<ul class="block__list">
				<li>Think more often about the consequences of your actions. Believe that even <span>small changes resonate in the big world.</span></li>
				<li>The next time you have an argument, try to behave in accordance with the laws and <span>find a compromise.</span> People with different opinions can coexist in the world.</li>
				<li><span>Reuse garbage and recycle it.</span> It is even better if you start buying products that are packaged as little as possible so that you don't have to throw anything away. <span>Buy only the essentials.</span> You will save a lot of resources.</li>
				<li>Start singing in a choir or join an interest group. The more you communicate with people in a team, perceiving them positively as a group of like-minded people, and not as individual unpleasant individuals, the better you will begin to understand the world around you and empathize with people: "This is not supported by any research, but I am sure of it - and I I've been living behind schedule almost all my life."</li>
				<li><span>Spend a lot of time in nature</span> with your children from a young age. Let them learn to respect the environment and the world in which we live.</li>

			<p>There are difficulties in translating this concept and interpreting it correctly — because this term changes its meaning depending on the situation and context. For example, it can mean:</p>

			<li><span>"moderation"</span> - in food;</li>
